##  Project Overview

This repository houses the **Python for Data Science and AI Module**, featuring real-world data analysis and visualization tasks. It serves as a hands-on learning platform and collaborative environment for contributors.

Currently included artifacts:

- **`online_retail.csv`** – Raw online retail transaction data.
- **`online_retail_cleaned.csv`** – Cleaned version of the retail data.
- **`unique_gifts_ltd.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook with detailed data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

##  Getting Started

Clone the repository and switch into its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pasindipamodagamage/Python-for-Data-Science-and-AI-Module.git
cd Python-for-Data-Science-and-AI-Module
````

Before contributing, please follow the branching conventions described in the **Branching & Workflow** section below.

## Branching & Workflow

Use the following branch naming pattern when creating new branches:

```
<type>/<short-description>/<your-name>/<YYYYMMDD>
```

* **type**: `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, or `chore`
* **short-description**: brief hyphen-separated summary of the task
* **your-name**: your full name or GitHub handle
* **YYYYMMDD**: current date in year-month-day format (e.g., `20250814`)

### Example:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/data-cleaning/pasindi/20250814

# Push to remote and track
git push -u origin feature/data-cleaning/pasindi/20250814
```

This makes collaboration transparent and organized, while keeping the project history clear.
